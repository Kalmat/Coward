# Coward

This is an evolution of the many 'Simple Web Browser' examples based on PyQt5 you can find on the Internet, adding:

- Tabs
- Vertical and Horizontal tabs positioning
- Enable / Disable cookies
- Wipe all cookies and history
- Download pages
- Download files
- Open a page in new tab
- Open a page in new window

Rationally, this will never be a good replacement for any of the commercial web browsers around. It is intended to serve as a reference for those looking for:
- Pieces of working code to complete their own projects
- A way to run a reasonably-well-working browser in those environments in which they can only install Python ;)

Yes, the fonts and images management can definitely be improved... coming soon.
